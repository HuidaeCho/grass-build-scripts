# Scripts for compiling GRASS GIS natively and using MXE

This repository contains scripts for compiling GRASS GIS natively and cross-compiling it for MS Windows using [MXE](https://mxe.cc/). Please refer to [How to cross-compile GRASS GIS for MS Windows](https://idea.isnew.info/how-to-cross-compile-grass-gis-for-ms-windows.html) for more details. You can download the latest portable daily build from [here](https://idea.isnew.info/how-to-cross-compile-grass-gis-for-ms-windows.html#latest-daily-build). Official daily builds from the GRASS GIS development team are available from [here](https://grass.osgeo.org/download/software/ms-windows/).

See [grass-mingw-scripts](https://github.com/HuidaeCho/grass-mingw-scripts) for native building on MS Windows.
